# PMX_Simulations
This Shiny application was created to assist in the simulation of pharmacokinetic profiles and the exploration of different dosing regimens.
Due to the great functionality and ease-of-use, all simulations were based on mrgsolve. Make sure mrgsolve is installed and working on your computer:
